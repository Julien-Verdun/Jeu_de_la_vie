# Jeu de la vie

Implementation of the game of life with Python and the graphical interface Tkinter

This code allows you to create a grid with black and white squares, randomly defined. Then, with the key up, you can play the life game.

This project has been implemented after the discovery of the game and has no other goal than trying it.


## Game demonstration


You can see examples of the game with 2 different grids (40x40 and 80x80).
